# [The Hodler Manifesto](https://hodlermanifesto.com)

The manifesto lives at:

**<https://hodlermanifesto.com/>**

# Contributions

Contributions are welcome, but the manifesto itself is mostly complete at this
point. I may accept changes to the document if you can make a very compelling
argument, and are also willing to update the translations.

I do, however, strongly encourage people to contribute:
 - Translations
 - Design improvements
 - Sharing and caring

## Contributing Translations

To contribute a translation, make a copy the manifesto
([`index.md`](/index.md)), and rename it to the name of your language and
region in [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
(language) and [ISO 3166-1
alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) (region) formats.
For example, Italian Italian would be `index-it_IT.md`. Add a link to your
translation in [`_layouts/default.html`](_layouts/default.html), and presto!
