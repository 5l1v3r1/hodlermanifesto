## Rule 1: A True HODLer Does Not Sell Their Coin

The first and most important rule of the HODLer Manifesto is to never sell your
coin. A HODLer may spend their coin (see rule 5), but a HODLer does not
sell.

## Rule 2: A True HODLer Buys the Dip

If the fiat price of their coin drops, a HODLer will buy more provided they have
the means to do so. **Under no circumstances would a HODLer panic sell because
they see the price going down**.

## Rule 3: A True HODLer Remains Steadfast In Spite of FUD

Whether there's news that China is banning your coin again, or your favourite
exchanged got hacked, a HODLer will continue to HODL. A HODLer stays the course
regardless who is sowing seeds of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Disregard the
news.

## Rule 4: A True HODLer Keeps Their Coins Off Exchanges and Online Wallets

No exchange or online wallet is immune from rogue employees, security mistakes,
or simple negligence. A HODLer will keep their coins secure by using a paper or
hardware wallet, instead of relying on a third party for custody and safe
keeping. **A HODLer always controls their own private keys**.

## Rule 5: A True HODLer Buys Goods and Services With Their Coin

If you decide to spend your coins, find vendors who accept your coins directly
rather than using fiat-based bridges (such as prepaid Visa cards). By spending
your coins, you fuel the ecosystem of fellow HODLers.

## Rule 6: A True HODLer Spreads the Word

Do tell your friends and family about your coin, but do not be pushy or pressure
others into buying your coin. They may not share the same values as you. Try to
educate and stick to the facts rather than appealing to emotions (like FOMO).

## Rule 7: A True HODLer Does Not Get FOMO When Another Coin Rises

When you see other coins quickly rising in market cap rankings, you will not be
distracted. They too will fall back from whence they came. Resist the temptation
to dump your coin and hop aboard another. If you must purchase some of another
coin, avoid going all in, especially if this coin has risen quickly.

## Rule 8: A True HODLer Will Run Their Own Full Node

To ensure their coin remains healthy, and to participate in consensus, a HODLer
will run their own full node if possible. There is truth in numbers, and a
HODLer will remain true to their coin.
